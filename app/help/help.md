# Welcome to OpenCampaign

This project isn't quite done but it's meant to be a D&D campaign planner.

## How do I access a campaign I have previously created?

Click on those buttons over to the left with text. If you have any campaigns you should be able to just click them.

## How do I create a new Campaign?

Hover the lil' red dragon at the top left, some options will come up (like the option to open this little help screen!). If you click new campaign then a new campaign will appear in the list and you can write it's name on it. Once you're done deciding the name you have to click `Enter` on your keyboard to complete.

## Can I export a campaign into markdown or a text file?

Not implemented yet but boy will it be fun when it's done.

Unfortunately, this help list isn't done because the project isn't done yet so this is all you get.
