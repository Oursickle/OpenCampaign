# OpenCampaign

This is my attempt of making a campaign planner for D&D Game Masters

Now let's get _This_ straight:

- _This_ is not for the players, it's for the game master to have all it's campaign encounters and items and whatever he creates in one place.
- _This_ is for game masters who don't like having to look thru folders or files for what a custom item or monster does or what NPC looks like.
- _This_ only helps the game master and won't make your campaign better.
- _This_ won't track your campaign, this will only store all the data needed for the game master to _game master_ his campaign

## FAQs

### What stage are we in right now?

_ahem_ `git init` :D

### Can you depend on this project to be done for your campaign?

No, I have less will to live than a deer so expecting this project to be finished any soon is very bad :c

### Why make this?

I couldn't find a campaign planner online for free or opensource so I decided to make one. All I could find was separated tools for tracking a campaign, npc makers, treasure generators and town/dungeon generators, if you want a list of tools there's a compendium i found on a forum from 2017 and some guy on reddit: [Some Guy on Reddit][0cbd948b] and [Forum from 2017][25622d1e]. So I wanted to make a simple app to have all your campaign stuff in one place because it can save time and not break immersion in a session.
